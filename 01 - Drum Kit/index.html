      <kbd>A</kbd> stands for a keyboard. 
      
      While data-key="65" eg is Custom data attributes are intended to store 
      custom data private to the page or application, for which there are no more
      appropriate attributes or elements. like an attribute like src is not custom
      but made up by html

      to find out the number of the keys on the keyboard visit keycode.info

      so when you clic a spefic data key it will run the audio data-key below in this file
      in other words when you click it hooks up on the audio file

      2 second: you wanna take the element on the page that has that 
      key associated. We are looking only for one element not all of them
      only the one with that key that is why we use querySelector 
      so you wanna take the audio with the data-key associated to the key we are looking for
      since the audio does not have a class in order to do that, you use the attribute selector with [] 
      like this audio[data-key="${e.keyCode}"]`

      const audio = document.querySelector(`audio[data-key="${e.keyCode}"]`);

      in that sense if you type a key not present you will get null. but if you do
      if (!audio) return; it will stop the function from running

      but if there is we gotta play the audio with audio.play(); but if will play only once
      so we should add audio.currentTime = 0; which will rewing the play
      and add the class with the effects

      better to say that isn't used to rewind or to stop the audio in the project.
      It's used to set the initial start time of the audio - which should start at the 
      beginning of the audio file and you would want that to be the value 0

      it works also after but It doesn't work exactly the same way - there is an issue if you trigger a lot of sounds at once.
      You need to use it before the audio.play() function so that it works correctly.

        transform is the actual transformation

        He uses it because transform is a CSS property defined in the style.css file on the .playing class
        which you add in the JavaScript code to the element. He then adds an event listener that will trigger 
        when the transition ends, which you can then use to inspect the type of event.
